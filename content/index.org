* Personal Knowledge Library
** Introduction

Hi there, and welcome to my Personal Knowledge Library! This is where I’ve gathered my notes, tips, and examples from my journey through DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and system configuration. It’s a space where I document what I’ve learned, so I can share it with others and have a reliable reference for myself.

Here, you’ll find practical insights on tools and workflows I use regularly, like Kubernetes, Ansible, Jenkins, and GitLab CI/CD. Whether it’s setting up pipelines, managing infrastructure, or troubleshooting tricky issues, these notes reflect the challenges I’ve faced and the solutions that worked for me.

Feel free to explore, learn, and hopefully find something here that helps you in your own work. This is a living resource, so it grows as I learn and discover new things. Thanks for stopping by!
