* UFW
** Uncomplicated Firewall
The default firewall configuration tool for Ubuntu is ufw. Developed to ease iptables firewall configuration, ufw provides a user friendly way to create an IPv4 or IPv6 host-based firewall. By default UFW is disabled.* Unified Firewall

** Rules usage
*** To check the status of UFW:
#+begin_src bash
sudo ufw status verbose
#+end_src

*** Allow all outbound by default
#+begin_src bash
ufw default allow outgoing
#+end_src

*** Deny all inbound by default
#+begin_src bash
ufw default deny incoming
#+end_src

*** Be sure to enable ssh first before enabling ufw
#+begin_src bash
ufw allow ssh
#+end_src

*** For custom ports
#+begin_src bash
ufw allow 443/tcp
ufw deny 80/tcp
#+end_src

*** Allow access to a port from a specific IP
#+begin_src bash
ufw all from 172.25.0.0/24 to any port 22 from proto tcp
#+end_src

*** Priority of rules
- if allow from all is present, it will be priortised and specific allow won't work

*** Deleting rules
#+begin_src bash
ufw list numbered
#get the rule number to delete and use below command to delete
ufw delete 1
#+end_src

*** Turning logging off and on
#+begin_src bash
sudo ufw logging off
#+end_src
